## EXPERIENCE

### Center for Translational Data Science at the University of Chicago

reactjs
python
kubernetes
terraform
golang

I work with the plan-X team at CTDS (https://ctds.uchicago.edu) developing the next generation platform for research data commons (see https://medium.com/@rgrossman1/how-data-commons-can-support-open-science-40b0d978d2fb). We are generalizing and extending the software and automation that drives the Genomic Data Commons (GDC - https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), so it can be applied in other research domains and deployed to Kubernetes or similar clusters in both public and private clouds. The technology we work with varies from Reactjs on the frontend to swagger/openapis defined public facing GraphQL and REST API's driven by python code on the backend to devops 
 and CICD automation with terraform, kubernetes, and jenkins.

I worked on the full life cycle (design, develop, test, deploy) developing Optimost (https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/customer-experience-management/opentext-marketing-optimization/opentext-optimost) (formerly of HP). The small Optimost developer team worked with a wide variety of technologies to implement Optimost's web-testing capabilities - from a clickstream analytics platform using Apache Storm and Vertica, to a legacy PHP backend that we extended with HTTP API's to support new single page web UI's using Backbone.js - working with tools like git, jenkins, Chef, maven, nodejs, gulp, less, and Docker to automate as much as we can.


### Bullingdon Research

amazon-web-services
backbone.js

This consulting contract evolved over time. I initially used parts of my littleware open-source project in a web application for interacting with financial models. I developed several custom javascript modules and UI components with scala backends to provide OpenId authentication and SVG charts. We deployed to AWS beanstalk.

I aided in the design, development, and test of a prototype distributed workflow support system. A SQL database stored a node-based data model manipulated via APIs served by a J2EE application server. A simple json over HTTP python binding allowed integration with Maya.

## EDUCATION

### Ph.D. Computer Science
Purdue University;
1994 - 1999

At Purdue I carried out research under the guidance of my adviser, Professor Vernon Rego, toward my dissertation: "Algorithms for Improving the Performance of Optimistic Parallel Simulation" (http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI9952158/).

The thesis explores various methods to decrease the runtime of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulation system on a network of workstations or other distributed platform.

### B.S. Computer Engineering
University of Illinois;
1990 - 1994

I worked on a senior project with Professor Loui that we eventually filed as a research paper - "A Fault Tolerant Distributed Algorithm for Minimum-Weight Spanning Trees" - http://hdl.handle.net/2142/74575
